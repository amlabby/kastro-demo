Civil dusk is a subtype of civil twilight. Civil twilight occurs when the sun is between 0° and 6° below the horizon. During this state the sky is still illuminated enough to see under normal conditions. Under ideal atmospheric conditions the brightest stars and celestial objects should be observable. Civil dusk occurs while the sun is setting after solar noon but before nadir.
