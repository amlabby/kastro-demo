Nautical dawn is a subtype of nautical twilight. Nautical twilight occurs when the sun is between 6° and 12° below the horizon. Some observable light may be present during this state. The horizon should still be visible on a moonless night allowing mariners to navigate which is the origin of the name. Nautical dawn occurs while the sun is rising after nadir but before solar noon.
